# ldid

This is simply a small update to [xerub's (well, saurik's) ldid](https://github.com/xerub/ldid) to compile for ldid2 which may be necessary for some iOS jailbreaks.

`ldid` and `ldid2` macOS binaries are provided for convenience.

# Compiling

To compile from source:
```
make
```

# Troubleshooting

If you're trying to install something like [Electra jailbreak](https://github.com/coolstar/electra) from source, you'll want to:
```
cp ldid2 /usr/local/bin
```
